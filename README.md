## Hi, I'm Norma 👋


### Glad to see you here!


I am a passionate 💻 junior front end developer from Spain. I am also an enthusiast learner 🤓who's always willing to learn and work across technologies💡. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems. I am currently a student of the front end development bootcamp at Adalab.

Committed to both individual and team work, for me, everything is a good chance to grow up personally and professionally. 

And if I come across a problem, I always look for a solution and… 🚀 Keep coding!


⬇️ I love connecting with different people so if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to be in touch!
